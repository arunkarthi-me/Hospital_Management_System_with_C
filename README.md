# OVERVIEW
### Implementing a hospital management system in C using structures and unions can be a structured and efficient approach. 
### Structures (struct in C) allow you to group different data types under a single name. They are useful for organizing related data into a cohesive unit. In the context of a hospital management system, you might define structures for entities like patients, doctors, appointments, etc.
### Unions (union in C) enable you to store different data types in the same memory location. Unlike structures, where each member has its own memory location, unions allocate enough memory for the largest member and share it among all members. Unions are useful when you need to store different types of data but only one at a time.
